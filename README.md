A [DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth](https://pypi.org/project/dipcoatimage-finitedepth/) plugin to measure roughness with integral FrÃ©chet distance.

## Usage

Subclass `IfdRoughnessBase` with your custom coating layer detection algorithms.
`RectIfdRoughness` implements the roughness of coating layer over substrate with rectangular cross section.

The command-line analysis provided by DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth is also applicable. An YAML example of the configuration file is:

```
data:
  ...
  layer:
    type: RectIfdRoughness
    parameters:
      roughness_type: "arithmetic"
      delta: 5.0
      opening_ksize: [1, 1]
      reconstruct_radius: 50
```

## Installation

DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth-IFD can be installed using `pip`.

```
$ pip install dipcoatimage-finitedepth-ifd
```
