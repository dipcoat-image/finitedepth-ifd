DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth-IFD is a Python package to analyze
coating layer roughness with integral Fr√©chet distance (IFD) in
finite depth dip coating.

Installation
------------

DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth-IFD can be downloaded from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/dipcoatimage-finitedepth-ifd/>`_ by
using :mod:`pip`::

   pip install dipcoatimage-finitedepth-ifd

You can also install with optional dependencies as::

   pip install dipcoatimage-finitedepth-ifd[dev]

Available optional dependencies for DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth are:

* ``test``: run unit test and doctest.
* ``doc``: build documentation.
* ``dev``: every dependency (for development).

Usage
-----

DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth-IFD provides :class:`IfdRoughnessBase`, which is an
an abstract base class that implements IFD-based roughness computation.
You can either subclass it to define your own implementation, or use
pre-defined concrete class such as :class:`RectIfdRoughness`.

You can use your class as a standard *coating layer* class in both Python
runtime or in an analysis configuration file for command-line invocation.
Refer to `DipCoatImage-FiniteDepth`_ documentation for more information.
